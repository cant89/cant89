I am a passionate Front-end developer, currently half Engineering Manager half Tech lead, and I work remotely for [TrustLayer](https://trustlayer.io/).

I am currently focused on web app development, especially within the React ecosystem. I have always been passionate about UI/UX, problem-solving, and data-driven approaches.
